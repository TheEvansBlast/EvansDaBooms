Abstract: An outbreak in terms of epidemiology can be defined as a sit- uation in which the amount of cases of a certain disease or virus is higher then the normal expectations in a particular region or season. The area of effect can be as small as a group but it can also be as large as thousands of people spread across entire nation.
Outbreak can further be   broken in multiple sub parts like Epidemics which generally involve infectious dis- eases, Food Borne which are caused environmentally and also Pandemics which occurs at a near-global scale and have a high chance to spread rapidly.
The maintenance of these outbreaks can be done by isolating the infected person and observe the change in his behavior and health. Early detection and reporting of such events is
 
crucial in minimizing their negative social and economic impacts.

Epidemic prone diseases, like emerging and re-emerging diseases constitute a huge threat to public health security and disturbance in social and economical development of the countries of Mediterranean Region.

In the past 2 decades, the rate of emerging and re-emerging dis- eases have increased up to a drastic rate. These diseases include Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever, Chiken-gunya, Cholera, Dengue, A/H5N1 In- fluenza, pandemic A/H1N1 and rift valley fever. The situation at their time worsened by acute and chronic humanitarian crisis in many countries of the Region.
 



 
           Introduction
Social media have been a very im- portant asset throughout the human history in terms of communication. First social media platform, a website named SixDegrees.com built in year 1997 was the beginning of this vast platform. Its been 25 years since then but still this platform keeps on de- veloping and will still keep going on. Talking to one another is now not the only thing one can do in Social Me- dia. It can be used to  learn  about new things that are being developed around the world.   Its can even help in alerting people about an outbreak of a disease. Considering the pan- demic that struck the whole world in December 2019, the news about the virus was also spread across the coun- tries through social media.The news of virus detection in Wuhan, China was itself spread trough the Social Media. It has played a very important role in helping people take proper pre- cautions and safety measures against any sort of biological anomaly across the world.
Social Media platform allows us to share ideas, thoughts, news, and opin-
 

ions over a large global scale. Pro- cessing data allows researchers to au- tomate and interpret the social me- dia posts for efficient and valuable dis- ease surveillance. Data obtained from the social media and internet search trends have been used to successfully monitor and  forecast  the  outbreak of many diseases like Zika, Dengue, MERS, and Ebola viruses. Recently, data obtained from social media have been use dot monitor and model dis- ease during the coronavirus(COVID- 19) pandemic.
Engaging in social media is a regu- lar activity done by billions of people around the globe. An output of using social media is the generation of large quantities of data.

   Background

1	  History of social media:
Social media can be described as an interactive digital  tech,  that  allows us to create, share, exchange infor- mation, idea, thoughts and opinions amongst one other. Usage of emoji, sticker, GIFs, images, audio  and videos can also be done in social me-
 




 
dia. The first media to be developed was Bolt,  created in 1996.  And now in 2022 around 4 billion are active in social media. Globally, the average person engage in social media about more than  2  hours  per  day.  With the spread of  Social  Media  across the world, there is a growing interest for using it to gain insight onto the outbreak of diseases and pandemics.

2	Surveillance using Social Media:
Social media   can be very useful in understanding disease outbreaks throughout the world using a method called Syndrome Surveillance. Syn- drome Surveillance can be defined as using health related data to pre- dict the probability of an impend- ing outbreak.  Social media reports on peoples perspective of inventions of slogans like Work  from  Home and ”Wear Masks” orders can be used to determine the effectiveness and to provide early insight into transmis- sion modalities. Social media has also been a centerpiece in forecasting and monitoring public perceptions and behavior during the Zika, Dengue,

MERS, and Ebola outbreaks. Peo- ple’s perception from the way they looked the pandemic are the key fac- tors contributing to increase in dis- ease prevention measures.
Studies tell that people primarily prefer using social media, rather than any other media outlet, to get an in- finite source of access to information related to anything around the globe.
Moreover, the practical evidences have told that using the social me- dia as an information-seeking plat- form have completely altered the pace of any outbreak of any sort of pan- demic or disease.
 



 
   Social Media and     Diseases:

Middle East Respiratory Syn- drome (MERS) is a respiratory viral disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Typical MERS symptoms are fever, breath shortening, cough etc. Human to human transmission of this disease is possible and have already occurred among close contacts and in health care setting. As a general precaution people who visit to barns, farms, markets or any place where multiple animals are staying should maintain proper hygiene for them as well as for yourself. People who have greater risk of getting infected should avoid contact with the barn etc. World Health Organization [WHO] to the topic of MERS disease continues to work with public health as a priority. Their team of specialist, clinicians, biologists and scientist have been very important as their research played  a  major  role  in  detection of the outbreak also through social media people across the countries were able to take proper precautions

against the disease.  Hence,  in  case of MERS social media played a very important role as well.

Ebola virus
This virus was firstly originated in West Africa in the year 2014, which caused huge havoc in African coun- tries. The term Ebola was named after the river Ebola where the first outbreak site in Zaire. The high mor- tality rate from this virus attracted attention of many biologists and sci- entists around the world when it was
 




 
finally published by WHO. The infor- mation about this virus was then re- leased through social media spreading awareness about the virus its symp- toms and its causes. The outcome of the surveys shows positive reviews to social media during the time of pan- demic or outbreaks.
Twitter data provide public health practitioners with quantitative Indi- actor of anxiety, anger, or negative emotions in general public where Twitter penetration is high. This in- dicator could help alleviate anxiety and correctly communicate the risk associated with Ebola.

Dengue
When dengue virus was spreading around the world in countries like Brazil, Malaysia,  India  and  Africa
, the disease outbreak had troubled many and naturally people took their plight to twitter, google and various and other social media. Researches collected various information to find about the effectiveness of social media in the detection of disease outbreak. Researchers collected information like number of tweets and google search on  some  particular  date  and  time,
 
they used a form of machine learning to only count the tweets with per- sonal experience of the people, like symptoms and problems they had faced, from opinion, parody, informa- tive and advertisement tweets. They collected the date-time and location of these tweets to determine how the virus is spreading and how to control it.    Using  social  media  turned  out to be an effective way as it became easy to predict the  further  spread and most of the predictions were actually true. Even google search trends helped these researchers to study the frequency of dengue related articles on websites like Wikipedia. All these showed immense association with the nationally reported dengue cases, nowadays estimates would be even better because people would search or post tweets if they feel and symptoms or illness. If we consider the traditional methods of preventing dengue like awareness programs or sending doctors and nurses to various places to guide people that way is very costly as compared to social media, and it does not even produce that much good result. People also do not physically report for symp- toms  and  illness,  they  like  to  stay at home get well soon, hence using traditional methods it becomes very difficult to actually find where the disease is spreading the most  and how is ti troubling the people. The case with social media is actually the     opposite because people would stay home and post on social media and scientist and other researches will get to know about them.  We can say that  social  media  turned  out  to  be a cost effective way to predict and estimate the spread of dengue disease.
 
             Conclusion
The main motive of this survey was to show how social media actually helped people throughout decades, during the time of any pandemic or outbreak. Our survey explains multi- ple topics, themes, and methodologi- cal approaches to track any outbreak or pandemic.  Amongst all the  social media out there Twitter was used the most to spread awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Accurate and Reliable information kept people updated time to time, helping them understand the various ways to maintain the social harmony even at times of pandemic.
